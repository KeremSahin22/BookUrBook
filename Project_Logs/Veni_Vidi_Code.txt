We got together to brainstorm (the project). Every member suggested his/her ideas and discussed them. 

08/10/2020
We came together to find a project idea and we finally found an idea, which gratifies all of us. As school-related materials are very expensive due to economic reasons, we thought of an app that enables students to sell their second-hand school materials on an online platform. In this app, students can either find and buy the necessary material or they can sell the materials that they do not need anymore. This app is focused exclusively on university students and on-ly they will be able to use it.
