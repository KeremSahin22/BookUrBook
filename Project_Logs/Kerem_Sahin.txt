# CS102 Project g1A - Kerem ŞAHİN personal log

On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project.

# 1 October -  25 October #
We have gathered with our team and did the necessary discussions and tasks for the project. I have also presented our first Presentation with Ferhat.

# 26 October - 1 November #
I have installed Android Studio on my PC. Since we want to implement it on android, I watched minor tutorials about the basics of the Android Studio.

# 2 November - 8 November #
For the UI Report, I have gathered every element (UI Design, Descriptions...) that is done by my friends and put them into the report. I have edited 
the necessary parts and added descriptions where I was necessary.

# 9 November -15 November #
----Midterm Week-----

# 16 November - 22 November #
I started to go a bit deeper about the Android Studio tutorials. I have learned how to connect different pages and how to send object informations 
between those pages.

# 23 November - 29 November #
I started to plan how to implement the Model Classes for our upcoming project. 

# 30 November - 6 December #
We started to work on our Detailed Design. According to the Detailed Design we have created, I started to implement the Model Classes and gather some 
of the other Model Classes
(Wishlist, Message, Chat) from Miray and Melih.

# 7 December - 13 December #
Model Classes were mostly finished. I started to look for minor mistakes, written the methods and connected the pieces from my friends. 
Model class was created faster than I thought so I also started to create layouts for the screens and I started working on trying to connect it with the model classes. 
I have also written the necessary activity classes.
