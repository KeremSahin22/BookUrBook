# CS102 Project g1A - Melih FazÄ±l Keskin personal logs

Until the 23th of November,i generally worked with my group about the project idea, reports, UI design and presentations. My individual works were related with these topics
like practicing for presentation, designing the storyboard of our app with the feedbacks of my friends or designing the application logo for our project.

# 23 November - 29 November #
This week, I started to watch tutorials about the basics of Android Studio. I downloaded Android Studio, SDK and other necessary tools to be ready for implementaion stage.

# 30 November - 6 December #
This week, we had a meeting about detailed design of our app. We discussed about our core classes. We focused on how to create an healthy MVC model and how to use OOP in
Andriod as much as possible. In our drive we created a document about the core class ideas and each member added their ideas to drive. Task distribution of our project has done in this week. 
My task is working on database and chat system.I worked on the model class design for chat system. 

# 7 December - 13 December #
This week, I started to learn database for the chat system in our app. I watched a tutorial length of 3-4 hours about an Android chat app which uses Firebase.
While watching it, i tried to implement a project like that app by myself to be ready for our app. For my personal project, i created an successful Login/Register system
but i had some issues about the database connection to chat. This study helped me to improve the designs of model classes of chat system. I also learn the basics of
Firestore database system. We also created our GitHub repository for our app.

# 14 December - 20 December # //THIS WEEK
In this week, we all started to work on our tasks. I worked on mostly the database structre plan and issues with Ferhat.
What I have done this week:
- Implementing the classes Chat and Message
- Creating the structure of database connection for ChatActivity class. For now, it retrieves the chat data of curret user without all messages and date of last message.
It also updates data in app whenever a change occurs in database.
- Using FireBase and Connecting MVC Models with the gotten information from Database for activities (with Ferhat).
- Login-Register-Logout systems on which only the users with @.edu.tr mails can register with a verification code that are sent to their email and uploading/ downloading those data
(with Ferhat)
- I give ideas to Ferhat about the designs of main menu, login, verification, register, and welcome screens. Implementations have done by Ferhat.
